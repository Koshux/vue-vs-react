### **CONTEXT**

- Great, I updated with what you provided and it looks good!

### **REMEMBER**

- I NEED to keep the same tech stack as described in the deliverables that implements every topic described but to the latest and greatest features available (therefore no deprecated code).

### **Our Immediate Next Goal**

- It seems like we never implemented the husky and lint-staged topics inside the monorepo that is published. I would like to implement them so that it's available please, as well as for my knowledge as I've only used them but not set them up properly (ensure latest and greatest of course!).
- Look at my updated code below for reference and please revise the entire project below to ensure correctiveness and that all is well.
