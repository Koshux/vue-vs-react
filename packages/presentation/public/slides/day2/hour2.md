Hour 2: Component Libraries & Theming

Why Use a Component Library?

Speed: Don't reinvent the wheel for every button, modal, and form input.

Consistency: Ensures a consistent look and feel across your entire application.

Accessibility: Good libraries have accessibility (a11y) built-in.

Best Practices: Battle-tested components for you to use.

Vue Component Libraries

Vuetify 3: The most popular. Material Design components. Very comprehensive.

Headless UI + Tailwind CSS: Our preferred stack. Headless UI provides unstyled, accessible components (logic only), and you style them with Tailwind. Maximum flexibility.

PrimeVue: Another very popular and feature-rich library.

Custom Theming: Most libraries allow you to override styles using CSS variables or SCSS tokens.

React Component Libraries

Material-UI (MUI) v5: The React equivalent of Vuetify. Huge library of Material Design components.

Chakra UI: Incredibly developer-friendly. Loved for its style props and accessibility.

Headless UI + Tailwind CSS: The same library works for both Vue and React!

ThemeProvider & CSS-in-JS: Common pattern in React to provide a theme (colors, fonts) to all components. Libraries like styled-components and emotion are popular for this.
