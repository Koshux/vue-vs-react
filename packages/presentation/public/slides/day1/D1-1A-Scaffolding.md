## D1.1A: Let's Build Our Apps!

**branch:** `day-1/01-scaffolding`

**Purpose:** Pair up and scaffold your group's application.

### Pair Up!

- Find a partner (or group of 3).
- **One half of the room:** You will be **Team Vue**.
- **Other half of the room:** You will be **Team React**.
- Your goal is to build your app from scratch. We'll compare notes at each step!

### Your Task: Scaffold Your App

From the **root** of the `vue-vs-react` directory, run **one** of these commands:

#### 🔵 Team Vue:

```bash
# This uses the official Vue scaffolder
pnpm create vue@latest packages/vue-app --ts --router --pinia
```

#### ⚛️ Team React:

```bash
# This uses the official Vite scaffolder
pnpm create vite@latest packages/react-app -- --template react-ts
```

_Follow the prompts, and say 'Yes' to installing/using pnpm._
